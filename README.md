# CycleVision
CycleVision helps cyclists detect traffic on the road and advises them of potential road hazards. CycleVision also tracks speed and heartrate. Traffic is monitored using computer vision (OpenCV) running on a Raspberry Pi 2. Data is sent from the Raspberry Pi to an Android phone using Bluetooth. The Android runs an app which displays speed, heartrate and a visual representation of traffic hazards.
